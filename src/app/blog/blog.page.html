  <p > When did work from home turn from a dream to a possible nightmare?
     <br> <br> At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of us were overjoyed with the idea of working from home. From getting away with longer sleeping hours to working in the comforts of our favorite pajamas, it sounded like the best thing ever! But as the line between work and home blurs, the downside of a work-from-home setup becomes much clearer to us.<br><br>Currently, companies are rethinking the future of work and workspaces. With the very real possibility of letting people work remotely forever. As a result, two-thirds of prime office space may become obsolete. So, if you’re anxiously awaiting to return to the office, there might not be an office for you to go back to.<br><br>What will this mean for the future of remote workers and employees? Especially in terms of mental and physical health?<br><br>Many studies have investigated the long-term impact of working from home on mental and physical health, which include:

  <ion-label class="subtitle">#1: Stress and Burnout</ion-label>
</ion-row>

<img class="images" src="../../assets/blog/article_12.jpg" alt="Remote working mother interrupted by playing children">
<p>Remote employees often experience higher levels of stress than their in-office counterparts<sup>1</sup> . In fact, nearly half of 20,000 surveyed people cite work-life balance and concentration difficulties as the biggest disadvantages of working from home <sup>2</sup>. Consequently, these disadvantages cause additional stress on employees. <br><br>A healthy work-life balance is much harder to achieve in a setup where work and home share the same space. Normally, our homes are an escape from work-related stresses. But working from home makes that escape impossible. <br><br>Similarly, personal stress at home can affect concentration, motivation and job performance. Moreover, juggling everything at once can lead to frequent burnout. </p>

  <ion-label class="subtitle">#2: Social Isolation</ion-label>
</ion-row>
<img class="images" src="../../assets/blog/article_13.jpg" alt="Remote worker lonely at home">

<p>Feeling lonely and cut off from society is a common pitfall in remote work - especially after sustained periods of isolation, like during community lockdowns. <br><br> On top of feeling isolated, staying home also makes it more difficult to feel truly a part of the team you work with. Nearly half of remote workers say that this social isolation is the worst part of not having an office to go to <sup>3</sup>.</p>
   <ion-row style="width: 100%;" class="ion-justify-content-start">
    <ion-label class="subtitle">#3: Poor Posture</ion-label>
  </ion-row>
  <img class="images" src="../../assets/blog/article_14.jpg" alt="Woman hunched over table while working from home">

<p>For many, working from home means working at the dining table or bedroom. But in the long run, desks and ergonomic office chairs are important. Roughly half of people who work from home experience pain in their neck, back or shoulders, stemming from poor posture <sup>4</sup>. <br><br>A part of this might also be because we feel more informal at home - meaning we don’t pay as much attention to the position we’re working in as when we’re surrounded by other people.</p>

  <ion-label class="subtitle">What’s the solution? Distributed working.</ion-label>
</ion-row>
<p >With the future of work unlikely to see us going back to large offices or city centres, WFH health problems will become more common. Distributed working - working from multiple locations - can help alleviate these issues and solve other important social and economic problems, without going back to commuting and rush hours.<br><br>It’s important for organisations  to sustain employee health and wellbeing and offer flexible work locations in the new normal. A professional workspace – without the commute – will become an important value proposition and competitive edge for employers in the war for talent—especially in high-end knowledge and service industries.

  <p > Modern cities have traditionally been the big hubs of business and activity. Now, the looming threat of coronavirus has transformed them into high-risk zones for infection. As a result, people are staying away and isolating indoors, giving bustling metropolitan areas around the world an almost ghost town-like feel. 
     <br> <br>We now do much of our everyday activities, such as working, shopping and going to school, online. And this shift might just be permanent. <br><br>So, as we move forward, so too must our cities. Adjustments and innovations undoubtedly will take place as we adapt to the new normal, but what does this mean for cities, exactly? <br><br>The new normal will impact almost every aspect of metropolitan life, from real estate to the way we work and move around:

  <ion-label class="subtitle">Real estate</ion-label>
</ion-row>

<img class="images" src="../../assets/blog/article_15.jpg" alt="empty downtown office building">
<p>As city life becomes less appealing to more and more people, the vacancy rates for commercial real estate will skyrocket. City planners will have to find ways to creatively repurpose offices and commercial centres in order to keep business districts alive. <br><br>Meanwhile, the demand for residential real estate will also likely drop, as citydwellers flee to the suburbs to escape crowded living conditions. In turn, property values may even out more across geographical areas, making downtown locations less expensive and driving up prices in out-of-town neighbourhoods.<br><br></p>
<ion-row style="width: 100%;" class="ion-justify-content-start">
  <ion-label class="subtitle">Commerce</ion-label>
</ion-row>
<img class="images" src="../../assets/blog/article_16.jpg" alt="young woman retail shopping online">

<p>Throughout this pandemic, e-commerce and online delivery have really thrived. In contrast, big shopping centres continue to see massive declines in foot traffic. <br><br>As more retailers move online and shoppers shun the crowds amidst health concerns, shopping malls will become increasingly obsolete. Instead, local and small businesses might become more popular alternatives for those wanting to shop in person, without taking on health risks.</p>
   <ion-row style="width: 100%;" class="ion-justify-content-start">
    <ion-label class="subtitle">Transportation</ion-label>
  </ion-row>
  <img class="images" src="../../assets/blog/article_17.jpg" alt="Asian commuters wearing face masks on a subway train">

<p>Since the onset of COVID-19, public transportation has been running at less than 60% of its normal capacity <sup>1</sup>. In the future, solutions like distributed working will reduce the need for long commutes and minimise the strain on public transportation systems - an important consideration in a world where people are way of travelling on packed busses and trains. <br><br>With people working closer to home and enjoying more flexible working hours, we can expect to see a serious impact on traffic patterns and public transport usage. Higher ticket prices for peak times and central zones, like the ALS, which cars are charged for entering will have to shift accordingly. The financial business case for city infrastructure is permanently transformed. New York City, as one of the hardest hit, announced a $16 billion budget shortfall and deep cuts as a result <sup>2</sup>. <br><br>But overall, fewer commuters and flexible working arrangements will also lead to efficiencies, less congestion, and time savings.</p>
<ion-row style="width: 100%;" class="ion-justify-content-start">
  <ion-label class="subtitle">Operating hours</ion-label>
</ion-row>
<img class="images" src="../../assets/blog/article_18.jpg" alt="crowded city sidewalk at rush hour">
<p>More flexible working arrangements mean that employees will no longer be chained to their desks, or to a rigid 9-to-5 schedule. <br><br>As a result, the usual rush hours will cease to exist. Traffic will be more evenly distributed throughout the day, and traffic patterns will also change. <br><br>The death of the 9-to-5 will also mean that restaurants and other establishments may need to revise their operating hours and staffing requirements to fit these new demand patterns. At the same time, companies will need to provide ways for employees to access offices and information at any time of day - like by using a digital keypad at a remote workspace. <br><br>In other words, all cities will need to become cities that never sleep.</p>

<ion-item style="--padding-start:0" lines="none">
<p >How will work evolve in a post-pandemic world? COVID-19 has challenged many of our norms, including our relationship with work. Since the Industrial Revolution, work has been tied to large, homogenous, physical spaces. Employees are frequently required to work alongside their colleagues in a confined environment.<br> <br>But social distancing and health protocols have revealed the uncomfortable truth about modern offices: they’re expensive and inefficient. In fact, corporate giants like Facebook and Twitter have announced plans for permanent remote working in the future <sup>1</sup>. But amongst employees, the work-from-home revolution incites mixed responses<sup>2</sup>. <br><br>Moreover, according to The Atlantic <sup>3</sup>: ‘Remote work might not work for many people in the future. But the status quo is already failing millions of people.’ <br><br>So, what is the future direction for work? What can we expect in a post-pandemic work landscape?<br><br> 
  <ion-label class="subtitle">Death of the 9-to-5 work hours</ion-label>
</ion-item>
<img class="images" src="../../assets/blog/article_1.jpg" alt="happy remote worker at her laptop">
<p class="image-tag">Flexible working conditions will allow employees to create a schedule best-suited to their needs and to work when they are most productive. Work value will shift towards productivity over clocked-in time<sup>4</sup>. As a result, instead of hourly wages, output-based pay will be the new norm.</p>
<ion-row style="width: 100%;" class="ion-justify-content-start">
<ion-label class="subtitle">Cloud-based future</ion-label>
</ion-row>

<p>Cloud-based software (like Google Docs), communication apps (like Zoom) and productivity tools (like Asana) are now readily available, and largely free to use. Collaborating and information-sharing have never been so easy! There is no longer a need for employees to flock to one location to get work done as a team.

 <ion-row style="width: 100%;" class="ion-justify-content-start">
  <ion-label class="subtitle">Increased efficiency</ion-label>
</ion-row>
 <img class="images" src="../../assets/blog/article_2.jpg" alt="skyscrapers and a cloudy blue sky">
<p class="image-tag">On average, companies spend $10,000 per employee per year on office space <sup>5</sup>. The cost is even higher in places like Singapore, where real estate is at a premium. Because of this, companies are projected to cut their office space requirements by at least half in the coming years. So where will their employees go? Companies will start to provide flexible workspaces, like distributed working solutions, instead.</p>
<ion-row style="width: 100%;" class="ion-justify-content-start">
<ion-label class="subtitle">Decentralisation</ion-label>
</ion-row>
<p>COVID-19 prompted a trial run for remote work on a global scale. We now know that working from home can be done. Thus, the next goal will be bringing work closer to home. Solutions like distributed working will eliminate the need for long commutes. As a result, employees will have the opportunity to live anywhere — be it outside the city, near good schools, or in affordable housing.

<p class="image-tag">A healthy work culture of networking and social bonding is difficult to maintain in a remote work setup. But under distributed working, employees can still enjoy face-to-face interaction — just without the health risks associated with large, communal office spaces.</p>

</ion-row>
<p style="margin-bottom: 90px;">From modern offices to densely populated cities, much of the existing work landscape is rooted in the Industrial Revolution. Factories required workers to assemble regularly and to move to highly urbanised areas to be able to get to work. This eventually fueled the growth of present-day office buildings. But thanks to COVID-19, a new mass migration is brewing, only this time, it’s going in the opposite direction. And there’s no turning back.

<p >Thanks to COVID-19, we are all — willingly or unwillingly — participants in the longest trial run for remote work ever. <br> <br> Currently, the work-from-home setup has had a mixed reception amongst employees. In a recent survey, 3 in 5 American workers wanted to continue working from home, even after the pandemic.<sup>1</sup>.<br><br>So what will happen in the aftermath? Will offices remain empty forever? Will this mean the end of public transportation? We’re hoping that the answer is a big no! Otherwise, think of all the amazing things we’ll be missing out on.<br><br>Here are 5 serious reasons why you should keep commuting to the office after COVID-19.

<p class="image-tag">Do you always feel like you’re missing out? Do you ever feel like you can never set aside time to do what you love? That’s what long commutes are for!</p>
<p>Imagine reading the first five books of A <i>Song of Fire and Ice</i>, or scrolling through endless news articles on your phone while the bus is stuck in traffic again. Or imagine listening to your favorite band’s newest album for the first time while you’re squeezed onto a train that feels like a human-sized sardine can.<br><br>Commutes to work are the perfect time to indulge in your favorite things. The more traffic, the better!</p>

<p class="image-tag">Did you know that the popular phrase, ‘out of sight, out of mind,’ was first spoken by an employee who was fired after taking a 2-week vacation from the office? Allegedly a true story.</p>

<p>But in all seriousness, actions speak louder than words! It’s impossible to prove your commitment to your job if you aren’t briskly walking past your supervisor’s office at least twice a day.   </p>

<p class="image-tag">Are you familiar with “meet-cute”? It’s the scene in every romantic comedy where the two soulmates meet for the first time, usually under unexpected circumstances. And of course, real life is just like a rom-com movie.</p>

<p>You can’t have your meet-cute moment if you’re working from home. You have to be in places where other people are — and riding public transportation maximisesyour chances of meeting your soulmate. Why? Because each commute offers a fresh set of tired and sleep-deprived faces.</p>

<p > The coronavirus arrived at the world’s doorstep like an uninvited guest. As it overstays its welcome, we are all scrambling to adjust - including companies and organisations  that are transitioning to remote working.
   <br> <br> With so much change on the horizon, long-standing social structures are bound to be affected — like life in the huge cities that flourished under the Industrial Revolution. Nowadays, a crowded metropolitan existence is no longer appealing to many - especially because the health risks are nearly as high as the cost of living.<br><br>Moreover, as the workforce decentralises  and employment opportunities become more distributed, people will be empowered to move out and migrate to the suburbs. In other words, it’s time for us to welcome back neighborhoods! Especially once distributed working becomes the norm.<br><br>But what does this mean for our day-to-day living? What are the benefits of living and working locally?

<ion-label class="subtitle">#1: Reclaiming free time</ion-label>
</ion-row>

<img class="images" src="../../assets/blog/article_4.jpg" alt="family moving out of a city apartment">
<p class="image-tag">The rise of distributed working promises fewer commuters and shorter distances from work to home. This will free up more personal time for employees, allowing more opportunities to bond with family and friends, or to pursue their hobbies.</p>
<ion-row style="width: 100%;" class="ion-justify-content-start">
<ion-label class="subtitle">#2: Community values</ion-label>
</ion-row>

<p>The ‘20-minute neighborhood’ will be the new benchmark for urban planning. Residents of these small, close-knit neighborhoods often have a stronger sense of community and flourishing social lives<sup>1</sup>. </p>
 <ion-row style="width: 100%;" class="ion-justify-content-start">
  <ion-label class="subtitle">#3: Less stress</ion-label>
</ion-row>

<p>Cities are stressful — traffic, noise and light pollution, crowded spaces, and higher crime rates. Not to mention the brisk-paced lifestyle. Living locally means not having to deal with these hassles anymore! It also accommodates a more grounded lifestyle, which can boost employee health and wellbeing.</p>
<ion-row style="width: 100%;" class="ion-justify-content-start">
<ion-label class="subtitle">#4: Reducing carbon footprint</ion-label>
</ion-row>
<img class="images" src="../../assets/blog/article_5.jpg" alt="leafy urban neighbourhood with no traffic">
<p class="image-tag">Aside from COVID-19, other global crises exist in the form of climate change, biodiversity loss, and depletion of natural resources — with us being the root cause. For example, when we travel long distances to get to the office, we regularly emit carbon that contributes to climate change. But bringing work closer to home means fewer cars on the road and lower electricity demands in urban areas, which can help alleviate pollution in big cities.</p>

<ion-row style="width: 100%;" class="ion-justify-content-start">
<ion-label class="subtitle">#5: More savings</ion-label>
</ion-row>
<p >Distributed working allows employees to save on commuting costs, like fuel and public transport, and expensive inner-city rents. Meanwhile, employers can save on office leases, energy costs, and other operational expenses.
</p>
<ion-row style="width: 100%;" class="ion-justify-content-start">
<ion-label class="subtitle">#6: Increased resiliency</ion-label>
</ion-row>
<p >Having workspaces spread out and located close to employees’ homes allows for continued operations. This will come in handy in the event of future localised lockdowns! There is a lower danger of transmission and minimal risk of infecting your entire team all at once.</p>
<ion-row style="width: 100%;" class="ion-justify-content-start">
<ion-label class="subtitle">#7: Supporting local economies</ion-label>
</ion-row>
<img class="images" class="images" class="images" src="../../assets/blog/article_6.jpg" alt="woman shopping at a local farmer’s market">
<p class="image-tag">Part of living locally includes supporting businesses with the neighborhood. Simple things like shopping at local farmer’s markets can make a great, positive impact. Plus, studies in Canada have shown that it saves consumers money in the long run2. All in all, local businesses will have more customers, suburban real estate markets will strengthen, and new commercial centres will open, creating more jobs outside of major cities.

<ion-label class="subtitle">Time to return to the neighborhood.</ion-label>
</ion-row>
<p >Living under COVID-19 restrictions has helped people rediscover the need for livability — walkable neighborhoods, healthier lifestyles, and stronger communities. The ‘work to live, live to work’ mindset has been replaced by a strong desire to work, live and play seamlessly.<br><br>Employees will want to create more rewarding, less stressful lives for themselves, with many opting to move back to comfortable neighborhoods. As a consequence, companies should be ready to offer flexible working arrangements, such as distributed working. Unprepared employers will find it harder to attract high-quality candidates in the future.
